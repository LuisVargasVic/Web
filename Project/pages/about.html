            <p> Here in Help Meowt! we are trying to figure out the mysterious way our feline friends behave and live with us, and with the help of cat owners all around the world to gather information on them. Cats are known to be as aggressive and as friendly as they can get, some may be as cuddly and playful that they seem to act like a dog, while others wont even bother to look at you, less alone let you pet them. And with the help of anyone that has a liking for cats, we can get to know these furry friends a little better, and with that help us as well! </p>
            <p> Cats are known to have an outstanding sensory system, being used as models for even neuroscience. They have good hearing, excellent vision that works in the dark, a very good spatial awareness, and a sense of equilibrium so good that they are famous for always falling on their feet. Cats have great cognitive skills as well, and there have been several tests about learning on cats that have had effect on some human education practices. </p>
            <p> Every breed has different traits and characteristics that can help us understand how cats act a bit better. And with the help of anyone, we can figure out how some breeds may affect even the health of our cats. Knowing what breed a cat can be, can help avoid some illnesses that can affect both humans and cats. A lot of people are allergic to cats (including some of our staff!) and not having the opportunity to have one of the best pets a person can have, can be very frustrating. Thankfully, there are some cats that wonâ€™t cause any allergic reaction!</p>
